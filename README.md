## What analysis led you to identify that product or service as a promising option?

<!-- Added by Vineet -->

The development of ScuderiaEstate was guided by key market research insights and stakeholder analysis, focusing on the evolving needs of real estate professionals and home buyers. The primary factors influencing ScuderiaEstate’s design and functionality include the rising demand for data-driven decision-making, the AI adoption gap in real estate, and competitor weaknesses.

### Market Insights Informing ScuderiaEstate Development

**1. Rising Demand for Data-Driven Decisions**

Anticipated changes in stamp duty regulations post-2025 are expected to shape first-time buyer activity in London. Recent trends indicate that increasing property costs have pushed first-time buyers to seek homes further from central London. In 2023, all London local authorities experienced a decline in first-time buyer mortgages per 1,000 dwellings compared to 2013, with the average London house price reaching £549,000 [^1]. This underscores the necessity for data-driven tools that empower buyers with insights on affordability and market trends.

**2. AI Adoption Gap in Real Estate**

Despite widespread recognition of artificial intelligence (AI) as a disruptive force, the real estate industry exhibits relatively low adoption rates. According to JLL's 2023 Global Real Estate Technology Survey, AI and clean tech solutions are identified as game-changers, yet many companies lack a comprehensive understanding of these technologies. Adoption remains limited, highlighting a need for ScuderiaEstate to provide accessible AI-driven property insights [^2].

**3. Competitor Weaknesses**

Existing platforms, such as PropertyData and Nimbus Maps, reveal notable gaps. PropertyData’s user interface can be overwhelming, while Nimbus Maps is associated with high costs and suboptimal mobile functionality. Furthermore, these platforms often fail to integrate critical variables, such as crime rates and environmental risks, which are essential for comprehensive property evaluations.

Stakeholder interviews with real estate agents and investors emphasized the need for explainable valuations (e.g., justifying prices to clients) and enhanced risk transparency (e.g., awareness of flood zones). ScuderiaEstate addresses these needs by leveraging machine learning models trained on extensive datasets (e.g. the Land Registry’s Price Paid Data spanning from 1995 to 2024).

# Market

## What are the important questions you need to find answers to?

### 1.Who are our customers? How can we customize our products/services to meet their needs?

Our potential customers include both individuals and professionals looking to buy or invest in London's real estate market, such as real estate agents, property developers, and home buyers and sellers. Since the real estate industry is constantly changing, our solution uses data-driven technology to integrate various data sources, including environmental factors and market sentiment analysis. By providing precise property valuations and comprehensive information, our platform supports users in making more informed investment decisions.


### 2.How do we resolve the data challenges related to our product?

To build a comprehensive and reliable real estate data platform, we will integrate multiple data sources covering property prices, transaction records, crime statistics, and market sentiment. Our data acquisition strategy combines web scraping, public open datasets, paid resources, and API integrations. Key sources include Land Registry, Ordnance Survey, ONS data, Google Maps APIs, and Police.uk API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for informed decision-making.

### 3.How to grow and generate revenue from the product?

To drive the growth and profitability of our product, we will implement a tiered pricing model, offering free access for individual investors while introducing a subscription-based plan for real estate agencies to unlock advanced features. This approach ensures accessibility for individual users while generating recurring revenue from professional clients.

Our financial strategy is focused on scaling the real estate technology platform from an early-stage startup to a £50 million valuation, ultimately transitioning into a Public Limited Company (PLC) and launching an IPO on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

We will begin by developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the support of incubators and accelerators, securing initial funding from angel investors, and progressively raising capital through venture capital (VC) funding. By following this structured financing plan, we aim to achieve key milestones, expand market presence, and build a scalable and sustainable revenue model.


### 4.Who are our competitors, and what competitive advantages do we have?

The current market offers several data-driven property platforms, such as PropertyData and Nimbus Maps, which provide valuable insights for real estate investors. However, these platforms also present notable drawbacks that hinder their usability and overall effectiveness. One major issue is their complex user interfaces, which create a steep learning curve and limit accessibility for less tech-savvy users. Additionally, the high subscription costs further restrict adoption, making these platforms less accessible to individual investors or smaller firms. Moreover, the mobile experience is often subpar, preventing users from easily accessing critical property insights on the go.

Another significant limitation of existing platforms is their lack of integration of key variables, such as crime rates and environmental risks. These factors play a crucial role in property evaluations, directly influencing investment decisions and long-term property values. Without these insights, users are left with incomplete assessments, increasing the risk of misinformed purchasing decisions.

Our product directly addresses these shortcomings by offering a user-friendly interface that enhances accessibility and usability. It provides seamless integration between web and mobile platforms, ensuring a smooth and consistent experience across devices. Additionally, it incorporates a comprehensive set of evaluation factors, including market sentiment analysis, crime rates, and environmental risks, to deliver more accurate and well-rounded property assessments. By improving usability, affordability, and data integration, our platform offers a superior and more reliable solution for real estate investors and buyers, enabling smarter and more informed decision-making.


## What relevant secondary research did you find?

### London Housing Market Overview

Recent data from the London Housing Market Report indicates rising market activity driven by buyer demand and property supply shifts. An increase in new buyer inquiries alongside a growing number of property listings suggests heightened market engagement. Since 2023, the availability of house-share rooms has steadily increased, though demand for rented rooms has fluctuated.

The RICS survey data reveals monthly changes in buyer inquiries and newly listed properties in London. Market demand saw a notable uptick in the last quarter, coinciding with the Bank of England’s first interest rate cut since May 2022. With a second rate cut anticipated, this momentum is likely to continue. At the same time, seller activity has increased, marking the first period of net-positive market activity since 2022.

Looking ahead, Rightmove predicts that the number of homes for sale will remain high throughout the year, intensifying competition among sellers and limiting significant price increases. However, the increased housing supply is expected to boost transaction volumes, with projections estimating 1.15 million completed sales in 2025.

A stamp duty threshold reduction set for April 1 could significantly raise moving costs for buyers. Rightmove’s real-time data already reflects a surge in first-time buyer activity in high-cost areas as they rush to finalize purchases before the new tax rates take effect. Despite this, many regions in England still offer homes under £300,000, allowing first-time buyers to benefit from tax advantages compared to second-home buyers.

Currently, the number of first-time buyers engaging with agents is 13% higher than the same period last year. With affordability expected to improve and rents continuing to rise, vigorous first-time buyer activity is anticipated to persist throughout 2025 [^3],[^4].

### The Growing Role of AI in Real Estate

Two years after the launch of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a transformative force across multiple industries, including finance, manufacturing, healthcare, education, and real estate. While the real estate sector has traditionally been slow to adopt new technologies, it now embraces AI to enhance decision-making, automate tasks, reduce costs, and improve customer service.

According to JLL's 2023 Global Real Estate Technology Survey[^2], AI and generative AI rank among the top three technologies expected to significantly impact real estate over the next three years. The industry has accumulated vast amounts of proprietary and third-party data, which is now being leveraged to develop AI-driven solutions tailored to real estate-specific tasks.

One area where AI is making a significant impact is in property listing descriptions, which have traditionally required considerable manual effort. Generative AI is now automating this process, generating unique, compelling, and SEO-optimized descriptions in seconds. Tools like ListingAI enable real estate agents to create high-quality property listings quickly, significantly reducing time and costs.

Accurately estimating a property's market value is complex, influenced by multiple factors such as location, property features, demographic trends, and environmental risks. AI-powered machine learning models analyze large datasets to produce real-time valuations, offering greater precision than traditional estimation methods. StadimData, for example, has developed an AI-driven platform that collects real estate data and automatically predicts property values, improving asset evaluations' accuracy.

AI and predictive analytics are also revolutionizing real estate investment. Advanced machine learning algorithms process detailed property data, including location, condition, market demand, economic indicators, and social media sentiment, to provide deeper insights. Leading investment firms like BlackRock utilize AI models to assess property values and identify lucrative investment opportunities on a global scale.

The London housing market is currently experiencing a shift, with increasing buyer activity and seller engagement driven by interest rate cuts and changing market conditions. The upcoming stamp duty changes and sustained housing supply will further influence market trends 2025 [^5]. Meanwhile, AI is reshaping the real estate industry through automated property listings, improved asset valuation, and data-driven investment strategies. As AI adoption accelerates, its impact on the real estate sector will expand, leading to greater efficiency, accuracy, and more intelligent decision-making in market transactions [^6]


## Stakeholders and Customers Research

<!-- TODO: Quanitfy -->

Stakeholders and customers are essential in identifying and shaping the application opportunities, whether in terms of the scalability aspects, market adoption or the overall feasibility, their insight will refine the features of the application ensuring it will align with the current industry needs. Therefore an analysis of potential customers and a well-constructed methodology to approach them is required to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and preferences.

Table 1 illustrates the potential customers and stakeholders for the application which are mainly within the real estate industries such as real estate agents, property developers and home buyers and sellers. The justification on why these groups in particular is due to their direct involvement and potential for them to subscribe to the product for instance the purpose for real estate agents to use the product may be to identify market trends, whereas property developers may be to compare the price between different areas. Nonetheless, these groups share commonalities the need for accurate real estate valuation and data driven decision making, both of which the product is able to provide.

In addition, the combination of semi-structured interview and online surveys are an effective methodoloigies to approach these customers due to that it offers both qualitative and quantitative data that will drive the development of the product. For instance, data from semi-structured interviews allow the understanding of the customer specific needs and expectation which could differentiate the product from competitors. While online surveys allow for a wider reach of quantifiable data on user preferences and potential adoption rates.

Table 1. Stakeholder Analysis and Potential Approach Methodologies
| Stakeholder | Purpose | Engagement Method |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------------|
| Real Estate Agents | Identify pricing factors and market trends| Semi-structure Interview |
| Property Developers | Identify and compare the price in specific areas and forecasts the price in multiple locations| Online Survey |
| Home Buyer and Seller | Improve their decision making through the use of the application | Online survey |

### Stakeholders Behaviours and Interests

The real estate marker is highly dynamic with different categories of stakeholders driving the transaction of the property. Therefore, understanding these stakeholders behaviours and interests is crucial in order to construct a real estate tool that will meets the industry needs.

1. Real Estate Agents in London areas - Real Estate Agents are one of the important stakeholders in which there are over 50,000 licensed real estate agents currently operating in London ranging from luxury properties, commercial real estate and affordable housing markets [^7]. Additionally, recent insights suggested that the commission levels typically range from 1% to 3% in which this indicate that an appropriate and accurate pricing strategies are crucial to be able to maximise earnings as well as many agencies nowadays heavily rely on data analytics and data-driven decisions to identify buyer preferences [^8]. Therefore this indicates that the team's product which is an AI-driven application could benefit from this need by offering real estate agents an automated valuation model to assess and identify property prices and track market trends.

2. Home Buyers and Sellers / Property Developers - Land Tech recently published a few insights which are that by 2025, 50% of London properties are sold to mortgage buyers and that by 2025, international buyers will purchase 20% of London properties [^9]. These insights can be further explored for instance taking into consideration that nearly 50% of London property sales will involve mortgage buyers indicating that tools that offer accurate valuation are crucial due to that buyers will require accurate predictions of future property values to be able to ensure that their investments remain viable as well align with the market trends. Moreover, taking into consideration certain demographics such as first-time home buyers can benefit from this as AI-driven information can offer insights towards undervalued areas, hence eliminating affordability challenges.

In addition, taking into consideration that 20% of London properties will be from international buyers emphasised the demand for data-driven insights for global investors. Hence the product that the team will offer will need to ensure that it offers market transparency since global investors often lack the knowledge and information regarding the local market and enable cross-area comparisons since foreign investors may seek to compare different areas within London.

LandTech further stated that international buyers were relatively attracted to the stability and potential returns of the London market with the combination of favourable mortgages and a competitive market this creates a perfect setting for buyers to invest in property [^9]. Hence, these statements further solidify the importance of data-driven insights and predictive analytics in helping investors make informed decisions and further support the need for tools that allow forecasts and predictions in order to identify growth trends and optimise investment returns.

Moreover, it was previously suggested that the real estate industry especially those within the property development sectors often been slow to embrace technology which leads to an increased gap in skills, knowledge and necessary training in data analysis, limiting their ability to harness data for decision making [^10]. The product the team's is offering aims to eliminate these concerns and allow property developers, investors and real estate professionals to make data-driven decisions through predictive analysis and property valuation models.

Taking into consideration the understanding of the stakeholder behaviours and interests it is important to identify and categorise these stakeholders based on their level of influence and interest in order to meet the expectations and ensure high adoption rates of the product.

Figure 1 demonstrates a power/interest grid which is a matrix used to identify and categorise stakeholders based on their influence and interest in a project. Real estate agents and Property developers would fall within high power and interest due to that they actively based investment decisions on the market trends, suggesting that their engagement is important to ensure that the product aligns with the current needs of the industry. Whereas, home buyers and sellers would fall within another spectrum of high interest but lower power because although they may be the direct users of the product but their influence to shape the market are lesser than real estate agents and property developers.

Indicate that our office and head quarters will be based in london to be in close proximity to the thriving real estate market in the city, additionally add the plan that we want to start as private limited liability company in the UK, to enable us to raise funds in exchange for equity and then once we reach a £50 million Dollars valuation, we plan to become a public limited liability company and IPO. We plan to register our company and patent in the UK and the US as our initial markets, and then expand to Europe, Dubai and major cities in Asia. 

Add whatever information you see fit for this section and include it in a markdown format with the largest header ####
-->


At ScuderiaEstate, our legal structure is designed to support our ambitious vision while ensuring flexibility, scalability, and investor confidence. We have strategically chosen to establish our **headquarters in London, United Kingdom**, positioning ourselves at the heart of one of the world’s most dynamic real estate markets. This proximity to London’s thriving property ecosystem—coupled with its status as a global financial hub—enables us to tap into cutting-edge market trends, attract top talent, and forge partnerships that drive our mission forward.

#### Current Structure: Private Limited Liability Company (UK)

We are launching as a **Private Limited Liability Company (Ltd)** under UK law, a structure that offers the perfect blend of operational agility and legal protection. This setup shields our co-founders from personal liability while allowing us to retain full control over strategic decisions during our early growth phase. By registering as an Ltd, we can efficiently raise capital from private investors, reinvest profits into innovation, and build a robust foundation for our initial operations in the UK and US markets. Our company registration will be filed with **Companies House in the UK**, ensuring compliance with local regulations and establishing our legal presence in this key market. [^59]


#### Intellectual Property Protection

To safeguard our competitive edge, we are also registering our company trademarks and patents in both the **United Kingdom** and the **United States**. These filings, managed through the UK Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), will protect our innovative solutions and brand identity as we enter these foundational markets. This dual registration strategy not only secures our intellectual assets but also signals our commitment to long-term value creation across borders.

#### Future Vision: Transition to a Public Limited Company (PLC) and IPO

Our growth trajectory is clear and bold. Once ScuderiaEstate achieves a valuation of **£50 million**, we plan to transition from a private limited company to a **Public Limited Company (PLC)** under UK law. This shift will pave the way for an **Initial Public Offering (IPO)** on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), unlocking access to public capital markets and accelerating our expansion. By going public, we aim to attract institutional investors, enhance our global visibility, and fuel our next phase of innovation. This milestone will mark our evolution from a nimble startup to a market leader, poised to redefine industry standards.

#### Global Expansion Strategy

While our initial focus is on the UK and US—two of the world’s most influential markets—our legal roadmap extends far beyond. Following our IPO, we will expand our corporate presence into **Europe**, targeting key innovation hubs like Berlin and Paris; **Dubai**, a gateway to the Middle East’s booming real estate and tech sectors; and **major cities in Asia**, such as Singapore, Tokyo, and Shanghai. In each region, we will establish subsidiaries under our PLC umbrella, tailoring our legal structure to local requirements while maintaining a unified global brand. This phased approach ensures compliance, scalability, and market adaptability as we grow.

#### Why This Matters

Our legal entity strategy is more than a formality—it’s a competitive advantage. Starting as an Ltd provides the agility to iterate and innovate, while our planned transition to a PLC positions us to scale with confidence. By anchoring our headquarters in London and securing intellectual property in our core markets, we’re building a resilient, future-ready organization capable of leading in a global landscape. At ScuderiaEstate, our legal structure is the bedrock of our promise: to deliver value, drive impact, and redefine what’s possible.

- **Advantages**: Simple setup, low cost, complete control.
- **Disadvantages**: Unlimited personal liability and limited growth potential. [^13], [^14]

#### 2. Partnership

- **Description**: A partnership involves two or more individuals sharing management, profits, and liabilities.
- **Cost**: No Companies House registration required; partners must register with HMRC for self-assessment which typically requires a solicitor and can cost anywhere from £500 to several thousand pounds depending on complexity. Without such an agreement, the Partnership Act 1890 applies by default. [^15]
- **Taxation framework**: The partnership itself doesn't pay tax. Instead, profits are distributed among partners according to the partnership agreement, and each partner pays income tax on their share through Self Assessment at the same personal tax rates that apply to sole traders. Partners also pay National Insurance contributions on their share of the profits.

- **Advantages**: Shared responsibility and expertise.
- **Disadvantages**: Joint liability for debts and potential conflicts between partners. [^13], [^14]

#### 3. Limited Liability Company (Ltd.)

- **Description**: A private company where owners' liability is limited to their investment in shares.
- **Cost (as of may 2024)**:
  - Online registration: £50
  - Same-day online registration: £78
  - Paper registration: £71. [^16], [^17], [^18], [^19], [^20], [^21]
- **Ongoing mandatory costs include:**
  - Annual confirmation statement: £34 online or £62 paper
  - Company name changes (if needed): £20 online or £30 paper
  - Voluntary dissolution (when closing): £33 online or £44 paper. [^18], [^19], [^20]
- **Taxation Framework**

  - Limited companies pay corporation tax on profits (currently 19% for small profits and 25% for profits over £250,000, with marginal relief between these thresholds). After corporation tax, profits can be distributed to shareholders as dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than regular income (8.75% for basic rate taxpayers, 33.75% for higher rate, and 39.35% for additional rate in 2024/25). Directors receiving salaries are subject to income tax and National Insurance through PAYE.

- **Advantages**: Limited liability, separate legal entity, credibility with investors. [^15]
- **Disadvantages**: More complex setup and higher administrative costs. [^13], [^14], [^22]

#### 4. Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)

- **Description**: Combines elements of partnerships and limited companies, offering limited liability to partners.
- **Cost (as of may 2024)**:
  - Online registration: £50
  - Same-day online registration: £78
  - Paper registration: £71. [^18], [^23]
- **Ongoing mandatory costs include:**

  - Annual confirmation statement: £34 online or £62 paper
  - Company name changes (if needed): £20 online or £30 paper
  - Voluntary dissolution (when closing): £33 online or £44 paper. [^18]

  While not legally required, an LLP Agreement is strongly recommended to govern the relationship between members. A basic LLP package including a draft agreement costs around £74.99 plus VAT [^21], though more comprehensive bespoke agreements from solicitors can cost considerably more.

- **Taxation Framework:**
  - Unlike limited companies, LLPs are "tax transparent" – the LLP itself doesn't pay tax. Instead, profits are allocated to members who pay income tax and National Insurance on their shares through Self Assessment, similar to a traditional partnership. This avoids the double taxation that can occur with limited companies, though it also means LLP members cannot benefit from the potentially lower dividend tax rates available to company shareholders.
- **Advantages**: Flexibility in management and limited liability.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires formal agreements and compliance with Companies House regulations, cannot raise capital by issuing shares like companies [^13], [^14]

#### 5. Public Limited Company (PLC)

- **Description**: A business structure managed by directors and owned by shareholders, with the ability to offer shares to the public and trade on a stock exchange. A PLC exists as a separate legal entity from its owners.[^23], [^25]

- **Cost (as of May 2024)**:

  - PLC incorporation: £199 to £299 plus VAT (for incorporations with up to two directors) [^26]
  - PLC formation package: £149.99 plus VAT (includes trading certificate)[^25]
  - Trading certificate service: £99 plus VAT [^26]
  - Additional fee per director/corporate shareholder: £55 plus VAT [^26]

- **Requirements**:

  - Must have at least two directors[^24],[^27]
  - Must have a qualified company secretary[^27]
  - Minimum issued share capital of £50,000[^27]
  - At least 25% of nominal share value must be paid up (minimum £12,500)[^27]
  - Trading certificate required before commencing business[^27]
  - Must hold an annual general meeting (AGM)[^27]
  - Must file accounts within 6 months of financial year end[^27]

- **Taxation Framework**:

  - PLCs pay corporation tax on profits[^27]
  - Profits can be distributed to shareholders as dividends, on which shareholders pay tax separately[^27]
  - Directors are usually employees paying tax through PAYE[^28]

- **Advantages**:

  - Access to substantial capital through public share sales[^24],[^29]
  - Limited liability for shareholders[^29]
  - Better access to credit facilities[^29]
  - Liquidity for shareholders[^30]

- **Disadvantages**:
  - More complex and costly regulatory compliance[^24],[^29],[^30]
  - Risk of hostile takeovers[^30]
  - Loss of control for original owners as shareholding dilutes[^30]
  - Strict disclosure requirements expose information to competitors[^30]
  - Shorter HMRC tax deadlines than private companies[^24]
  - Pressure for short-term results from shareholders[^30]

For our startup inorder to seek scalability and investor confidence, a **Limited Liability Company (Ltd.)** is the most suitable option due to its liability protection and growth potential.




## Which resources do you need and how will you get them?

### Technological Resources

The business requires significant technological infrastructure to develop and deploy its AI-powered application. This includes:

- AI Model Development: The data science team will develop the machine learning model in-house, utilizing historical and real-time real estate data for training. The plan mentions implementing an AI training pipeline, focusing on collecting and cleaning market data, which suggests in-house capability.

- Application Development: The software development team will design and implement a user-friendly application, likely using standard development tools and frameworks. This is inferred from the need for a user interface allowing property queries and cost predictions.

- Data Collection and Processing Infrastructure: Given the need for real-time updates and daily data feeds from APIs and news sources, the business will require scalable computing power and storage. Cloud services like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud are likely choices, offering flexibility and scalability, as seen in industry practices for real estate tech startups [^31].

Acquisition Strategy: These resources will be developed in-house where possible, with necessary hardware and software purchased or leased from providers. Cloud services will be subscribed to, ensuring cost-effective scalability.

### Real Estate Data

The foundation of any Geographic Intelligence platform focused on property price prediction lies in its data infrastructure. For our London-centric platform that combines exceptional UX with ML-powered predictive analytics, addressing the dataset challenge is paramount to delivering accurate insights. Property data forms the cornerstone of our service, and without comprehensive, high-quality datasets, our predictive capabilities would be severely limited. The datasets we require must span historical transactions, geographic boundaries, property characteristics, and contextual information that influences pricing trends across London's diverse neighborhoods.

Property price prediction requires multidimensional data that captures not only basic transaction information but also the nuanced factors that influence real estate valuation. As noted in academic research on London housing price prediction, "various information are provided and can be categorised as follows: ID (Transaction ID), Date, Transaction Price, Property classification (Type, Build, Tenure), and Address information"[^32]. This diverse data spectrum necessitates a strategic approach to data acquisition and management to ensure our platform delivers accurate predictions and intelligent insights for decision-making.

- Core Dataset Requirements

  - Our platform requires several categories of data resources to power its predictive capabilities. The primary datasets we need include historical property transaction records, comprehensive property attribute information, geographic and spatial data, and contextual market indicators. Each of these components plays a vital role in training our machine learning models to generate accurate property price predictions across London's real estate landscape.

    Historical property transaction data provides the foundation for understanding price movements over time. This includes records of every property sale in London, ideally spanning at least 10-15 years to capture multiple market cycles. Land Registry's Price Paid Data (PPD) offers "information on single residential property sales in England and Wales, sold for value, that are lodged with us for registration"[^33]. This dataset is crucial as it provides the ground truth for actual market transactions that our models will learn from and attempt to predict.

    Property attribute information helps our algorithms understand the physical and legal characteristics that influence property values. This includes details such as property type (detached, semi-detached, terrace, flat), build status (new or existing construction), tenure (leasehold or freehold), number of bedrooms, and other features that significantly impact property valuation [^32]. Without these attributes, our prediction models would lack the granularity needed for accurate price estimation.

    Geographic and spatial data provides the critical locational context that is fundamental to real estate valuation. This includes boundary files, postcode data, and polygon information that defines neighborhoods, boroughs, and administrative areas within London. The Ordnance Survey's MasterMap and address data with Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs) are essential resources as they provide "the only official, up-to-date register of all nationally protected historic buildings and sites in England" [^34]. This geographic precision enables our platform to offer location-specific insights through our map-based interface.

- Strategic Data Acquisition Approach

  - The Land Registry provides essential transaction data through their Price Paid Data service, which is "available for use and reuse under the Open Government Licence (OGL)" [^33]. This comprehensive dataset contains historical property sales information that forms the backbone of our price prediction models. We will implement automated data pipelines to regularly download and process updates to this dataset, ensuring our models always incorporate the latest transaction information. The historical depth of this dataset, which extends back to 1995, provides sufficient temporal coverage for identifying meaningful patterns and trends in London's property market [^32].

    The Greater London Authority's London Datastore offers additional property transaction details specifically for Greater London, complementing the Land Registry data with more localized information. Their "Housing in London" reports provide "the evidence base for the Mayor's housing policies, summarising key patterns and trends across a wide range of topics relevant to housing in the capital" [^35]. By incorporating this dataset, we can enrich our models with London-specific housing contexts and policy impacts that influence property values across different boroughs.

    Ordnance Survey data resources, particularly their AddressBase system with Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs), provide the spatial foundation for our geographic intelligence platform. Under the Public Sector Geospatial Agreement, certain OS MasterMap data is now available under open license terms, allowing us to "publish property extents created from OS MasterMap Topography Layer under Open Government Licence (OGL) terms" [^36]. This data will power our map-based interface, enabling users to visualize property price predictions with precise geographical context.

### Crime Data

Crime data serves multiple functions within a real estate intelligence platform. It helps investors identify undervalued areas where improving safety metrics may signal future price appreciation. It provides crucial information for home buyers concerned about personal safety and property security. For real estate professionals, it delivers data-driven insights to address client concerns regarding neighborhood safety. This multidimensional utility makes crime statistics an invaluable resource for enhancing the platform's predictive algorithms and user experience.

- Police.uk Open Data Portal:

  The Police.uk platform represents the official repository for crime and policing data across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. This comprehensive resource provides street-level crime data, outcome information, and stop-and-search statistics in standardized CSV formats. The platform also offers a robust API that enables programmatic access to detailed crime data and information about individual police forces and neighborhood teams[^37].

  For integration purposes, Police.uk provides two particularly valuable API endpoints: "Street-level crimes" and "Crimes at a location." The street-level crimes endpoint allows retrieval of crime data within a 1-mile radius of a specified point or within a custom-defined area. This granular approach enables precise neighborhood-level crime analysis. The API returns categorized crime data including anti-social behavior, bicycle theft, burglary, and various violent crime categories, enabling multidimensional safety analysis[^38].

  The "Crimes at a location" endpoint returns crimes that occurred at specific locations rather than within a radius. When provided with latitude and longitude coordinates, it identifies the nearest pre-defined location and returns associated crime reports. This functionality allows for highly localized crime assessment when evaluating specific properties[^39].

  - Acquisition Strategy:

    The platform will implement a direct API integration with Police.uk, leveraging both endpoints to retrieve crime data at different geographic scales. A scheduled data pipeline will ensure regular updates, with more frequent updates for high-interest areas. Given that some API requests may exceed character limits for GET requests, the implementation will include POST request capabilities for submitting complex geographic queries[^38].

- London Datastore: Metropolitan Police Service Recorded Crime

  The London Datastore provides official recorded crime data at three geographic levels: Borough, Ward, and Lower Super Output Area (LSOA). This dataset counts crimes monthly according to specific crime types, offering exceptional geographic precision for London-specific analysis. The data is available in two formats for each geographic level: the most up-to-date information covering the last 24 months and historical data covering full calendar years back to 2008[^40].

  The dataset provides comprehensive crime categorization according to Home Office classifications, including detailed breakdowns for major categories such as Arson and Criminal Damage, Burglary, Drug Offenses, Miscellaneous Crimes Against Society, Possession of Weapons, and Public Order Offenses. This granular categorization enables sophisticated crime pattern analysis and trend identification across London's diverse neighborhoods[^40].

  - Acquisition Strategy:

    The platform will establish an automated data pipeline to download and process regular updates from the London Datastore. Given the standardized format of the data, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes will be implemented to integrate this information with the platform's database. Historical data will be used for training predictive models, while the most recent 24-month data will inform current risk assessments and trend analyses.

- Office for National Statistics (ONS) Crime Data

  The ONS provides authoritative crime statistics for England and Wales, including detailed Police Force Area data tables. These datasets offer comprehensive crime figures by Police Force Area and Community Safety Partnership areas, which typically align with local authorities. The data is updated quarterly, providing regular refreshes of crime statistics that can inform trend analysis and predictive modeling[^41].

  - Acquisition Strategy:

    The platform will implement scheduled data collection from the ONS portal, focusing on the Metropolitan Police data relevant to London. This data will primarily serve as a validation layer and for broader trend analysis, complementing the more granular data from Police.uk and the London Datastore.

### Marketing Resources

To effectively reach and acquire customers in the real estate sector, a multi-channel approach is essential. The following marketing channels will help target real estate agents, property developers, and home buyers/sellers:

- Acquisition Strategy:

  - Digital Platforms

    - **Website/App**: Direct sign-ups for subscriptions[^42], [^43]
    - **App Stores**: iOS/Android apps[^44][^45]
    - **Social Media**: LinkedIn/Instagram ads targeting investors[^42],[^46],[^43]

  - Strategic Alliances

    - **Partnerships**: Co-marketing with mortgage brokers[^47][^48]
    - **Events**: Real estate expos, investor meetups [^47],[^43]

This comprehensive marketing approach aligns with successful strategies used by leading proptech companies. Social media platforms have become essential real estate marketing tools for professionals to keep up with current trends[^42]. Companies like Zillow and Redfin have demonstrated the effectiveness of digital transformation in customer acquisition[^49]

For maximum impact, these channels should be integrated with consistent branding and messaging across platforms[^46]. Content marketing through these channels should showcase your unique value proposition and address specific pain points in the real estate market [^48],[^43]).

Successful real estate tech startups like RentSpree and Azibo have leveraged these marketing channels to achieve significant growth and market penetration[^44]. By implementing platform-specific enhancement strategies and cross-channel optimization, you can maximize the effectiveness of your marketing efforts [^46].

<!-- Added by Sam Alshoabi: AI Assissted in write up, while cost projections are designed in excel sheet based on estimates for needs. Excel sheet is attached in the resources section. Answer is reviewed and selection of timeline, incubators, amounts and equity is adjutsed.  
Prompt: 
Now I need your help with Financing. My initial plan is we would like to start by getting into an incubator/accelerator, one that will help us find the product market fit, and guide us in the efforts of building the product. Preferably one that would provide an investment as well. It will be ideal if this incubator/accelerator will help us get to pitch our idea to angel investors and Venture Capitals. Align your answer with plan in raisting min (100K in Preseed, 500K in seed round, £5M in Series A, and £10 in Series B) set a 6 years timeline to reach a 50 million valuation and determine the forecasted valuation at each stage of funding. Make sure that each funding round covers expenses from 18-24 months post pre-seed round. 
-->


At ScuderiaEstate, our financing strategy is crafted to drive innovation, secure product-market fit, and transform our real estate technology solution into a globally recognized platform. We will kickstart this journey by leveraging a top-tier incubator or accelerator, gaining initial capital, expert guidance, and access to networks that position us for subsequent funding from angel investors and venture capitalists (VCs). Our primary objective is a £50 million valuation, enabling a transition to a Public Limited Company (PLC) and unlocking exit opportunities—either through acquisition by major industry players or an Initial Public Offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Below, we detail our approach to initial funding, outline subsequent rounds, and provide a projected timeline to achieve this milestone.

#### Initial Step: Joining an Incubator or Accelerator

To lay a strong foundation, we plan to join a prestigious incubator or accelerator program that aligns with our needs: refining product-market fit, building our property valuation platform, and securing seed funding. Our ideal program will provide:
<!--- Financing comment: Values based on Slides --->
- **Pre-Seed Investment:** A modest capital injection ~£500,000 **"As Safe-Note"** capped at £10M valueation with no initial equity. This investment capital will be used to fund early development and operations.[^50]
- **Mentorship and Resources:** Guidance from experienced entrepreneurs, real estate experts, and technologists to shape our product and business model.
- **Access to Investors:** Opportunities to pitch to angel investors and VCs, either through demo days or curated introductions, accelerating our path to follow-on funding.
- **Focus on Real Estate Tech:** A program with expertise in proptech or related fields to ensure tailored support.

**Preferred Programs:**

- **Acceler8 (UoB's Startup Accelerator):** Offers £1,500 with 0% equity to help get the company up the ground, cover legal and adminstrative fees for registering the company, setting up bank accounts, purchasing domain and essential equipments.
- **Pi Labs (Proptech Focus):** 12-week highly-tailored programme designed to generate sustainable growth for early-stage companies transforming the built world. The program offers £350,000 in pre-seed funding. [^51]
-  **NAR Reach (Proptech Focus):** In partnership with Second Century Ventures (SCV) & Property Mark, provides a 9-month proptech focused incubation journey. This journey offers connections with top real estate executives, industry associations and decision makers, with the opportunity to receive guidance from leading entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and property professionals.[^52]
- **Techstars London:** Invests $20,000 plus $4M in credit and perks for 6% common equity over a 3-month program, with a focus on tech-driven solutions and a robust mentor network. Additionally, they offer $100,000 USD in exchange for a Convertible Promissory Note[^53]
-  **Y Combinator (YC):** Offers $125,000 for 7% equity & $375,000 on an uncapped safe with a Most Favored Nation, a 3-month program designed to help startups really take off.[^54]

By joining such a program in **Q4 2025 - Q1 2026**, we expect to exit with a validated minimum viable product (MVP), initial traction (e.g., pilot users in London’s real estate market), and a clear pitch for angel funding, by **Q3  2026**.

#### Funding Rounds and Capital Needs

Our journey to a £50 million valuation will progress through standard startup funding stages, each tied to specific milestones. Below is an overview of the rounds, their purposes, and estimated amounts, adjusted for our proptech focus and London base.

1. **Pre-Seed Round (Incubator/Accelerator Funding)**

   - **Amount:** £100,000 -£500,000
   - **Source:** Incubator/accelerator investment/ Angel Investors
   - **Purpose:** Develop the MVP, conduct market research on foreign investors and London real estate trends, establish initial operations and gain initial traction.
   - **Equity:** Safe-Note with £10M Valuation Cap. 
   - **Timeline:** Q2 2026 (3–6 months post-launch).

2. **Seed Round**

   - **Amount:** £500,000–£1.5 million
   - **Source:** Angel investors, early-stage VCs, and accelerator alumni networks
   - **Purpose:** Refine the product (e.g., integrating crime data, disaster risks, and market trends), acquire initial customers (foreign investors), and build a small team & R&D (e.g., hire additional data scientists, engineers).
   - **Equity:** 10%
   - **Valuation:** £2.5–£7.5 million (post-money)
   - **Timeline:** Q3–Q4 2026 (6–12 months after pre-seed).

3. **Series A**

   - **Amount:** £5–£10 million
   - **Source:** Venture capitalists, possibly with angel co-investors
   - **Purpose:** Scale the platform (e.g., expand to US and European markets), enhance AI-driven predictive models, and grow the team (e.g., sales, marketing).
   - **Equity:** 15–20%
   - **Valuation:** £12–£40 million (post-money)
   - **Timeline:** Q2 2028–Q4 2028 (18–24 months after seed).

4. **Series B**
   - **Amount:** £10-£20 million
   - **Source:** VCs, private equity firms
   - **Purpose:** Accelerate global expansion (e.g., Dubai, Asia), optimize operations, and prepare for an IPO.
   - **Equity:** 10–20%
   - **Valuation:** £40–£80 million (post-money)
   - **Timeline:** Q2 2030–Q4 2030 (18–24 months after Series A).
  

#### Timeline to £50 Million Valuation

Reaching a £50 million valuation could take 5–7 years for high-growth tech startups, though proptech firms with strong traction can accelerate this. Based on our London base, real estate focus, and incubator start, here’s a projected timeline:

- **Year 1 (2026):** Pre-seed via incubator/accelerator. Exit with an MVP and £50k–£150k, valuing us at £500k–£1.5m.
- **Year 2 (2027):** Seed round raises £1m, driving product refinement and early revenue. Post-money valuation: £5m–£7m.
- **Years 3–4 (2028–2029):** Series A raises £5m, scaling to multiple markets. Valuation climbs to £20m–£40m.
- **Years 5–6 (2030–2031):** Series B raises £10m, achieving £50m+ valuation by demonstrating £2.5m-£5m in annual recurring revenue (ARR) at a 10–20x revenue multiple.

This assumes a 50–100% annual growth rate post-seed, fueled by demand from foreign investors and a unique data-driven platform. Risks (e.g., market saturation, regulatory hurdles) could extend this to 7–10 years, while exceptional traction (e.g., partnerships with major real estate firms) could shorten it to 4–5 years.

#### Why This Approach Works


Starting with an incubator/accelerator mitigates early-stage risks by providing capital, expertise, and investor access—essentials for a proptech startup like Entrepreneurs to establish product-market fit. Our staged funding rounds align with key milestones—building, scaling, and globalizing—while our London headquarters taps into a premier real estate market to attract angel investors and venture capitalists. Targeting a £50 million valuation positions ScuderiaEstate for an exit strategy, either through acquisition or an IPO on the London Stock Exchange, unlocking public capital to redefine property valuation globally. Should we significantly disrupt the proptech sector, we could aim for a £100-£250 million valuation, potentially pursuing a Series C or later round to raise £20–£50 million, fueling broader global expansion prior to an IPO or strategic acquisition.


**Note:** This investment will help us acquire ~700K downloads and retail ~170K Quarterly Active Users (QAU), this projection was based on the below assumptions:
1. 1-Quarter User Retention = 10%
2. 2-Quarters User Reterntion = 5%
3. 3-Quarters User Retention = 3%
4. Avg Cost per customer acquistion/download = £15

## What are the main risks to the success of your business and how will you address or mitigate them?

We conducted a PESTLE analysis to identify external factors that may hinder the success of the business.

As a result of the SWOT and PESTLE analyses, we have identified the critical internal and external issues that are most likely to hinder the company's success.

### **Critical Risk 1: Labour Shortages**

#### Problem Description

Our business is highly dependent on online payments and overseas investors as key revenue sources. Therefore, we need experts in data security, privacy, and legal regulations, but there is currently a shortage of the necessary talent. Several competitors in the real estate industry are already hiring AI engineers and real estate experts. These companies offer high salaries and comprehensive benefits, making it challenging to acquire skilled professionals.  
If this issue is not addressed, future AI regulations or tax system changes may cause delays in compliance due to the lack of in-house experts. In more severe cases, failure to comply with regulations could result in penalties or legal sanctions.  
This problem is closely linked to several risks identified in the PESTLE analysis, such as reduced hiring due to economic recessions and a sharp increase in remote work caused by the pandemic. If not properly mitigated, these factors could jeopardise the survival of the company's services.

#### Mitigation Plan for Labour Shortages

To prevent this situation from occurring, we are considering several proactive measures.

1. Working Environment and Recruitment:  
   We aim to attract talented individuals by offering competitive working conditions. For example, we will introduce a stock option system to address talent shortages at an early stage. Additionally, we will enable full remote work, allowing us to recruit skilled professionals from around the world. This will not only expand the talent pool but also help secure employees who are familiar with the legal frameworks in regions where overseas investors reside. Furthermore, by hiring senior personnel, we can immediately strengthen our workforce.

2. Talent Training:  
   We provide tuition assistance and employee training programs to foster skill development for existing employees. We also cross-train employees from other departments with the technical or legal departments. This training allows employees to become familiar with the responsibilities of various departments in advance and allows operations to continue even if key personnel are unavailable.

#### Contingency Plan for Labour Shortages

If a labour shortage materialises, we will implement the following contingency measures.

1. Overtime and Reassignment of Existing Employees:  
   For short-term vacancies, existing employees will temporarily work overtime. Additionally, we will reassign employees who have undergone cross-training to fill critical vacant positions.

2. Utilisation of External Resources:  
   For long-term vacancies, we will hire freelancers or contract employees. Furthermore, we will outsource specialised tasks through temporary contracting where necessary.

3. Reduction of Work Scope:  
   If the above measures prove insufficient, we will consider temporarily reducing the scope of work. Specifically, if servicing overseas investors becomes difficult, we will prioritise the domestic market. Additionally, we will pause new feature development and focus on ensuring the stable operation of existing services.

### **Critical Risk 2: Regulatory Changes**

#### Problem Description

The second biggest risk we envision is regulatory changes.  
For example, government policies could restrict foreign investors from purchasing real estate. In Canada, a new law was enacted that prohibits non-Canadians from purchasing residential real estate for two years starting in 2023[^55]. In Australia, foreign investors will be prohibited from purchasing second-hand homes for two years from April 2025[^56]. In the UK, there are still few regulations, but they may suddenly be strengthened due to future disputes or changes in public opinion. In such a case, overseas investors—our key customers—may withdraw, making it difficult for the business to survive.

Additionally, AI-based pricing could be considered market manipulation in the future. In 2024, in the United States, real estate software company RealPage was sued by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) for violating antitrust laws due to alleged price manipulation using algorithms[^57]. The company’s AI-based rent-setting software was suspected of artificially inflating rents for rental properties and restricting market competition. Since AI-powered real estate transaction services are still new, regulations are not yet fully developed. In the future, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) may impose stricter regulations, which might lead to inspections and a loss of trust in the platform.

#### Mitigation Plan for Regulatory Changes

We are considering multiple countermeasures to mitigate the above risks.

1. Keeping Up with the Latest Trends:  
   We will hire a legal advisor to provide guidance on legal changes and regulatory developments in the UK. At the same time, we will stay informed of early signs of regulatory shifts.

2. Ensuring Fairness and Transparency:  
    According to Morgan Lewis[^58], ensuring transparency in the logic behind price calculation is a key requirement for regulatory compliance. Therefore, we will educate employees on AI pricing logic, ensuring that it remains explainable. Additionally, by disclosing this process to regulators and users, we aim to enhance transparency and reduce distrust in the service.  
   At the same time, we will conduct evaluations by independent auditing agencies multiple times a year to verify the fairness of pricing.

#### Contingency Plan for Regulatory Changes

1. If regulations on AI pricing are tightened:  
   We will revise our AI pricing process to comply with new regulations under the guidance of the auditing agency.

2. If regulations on foreign investors are tightened:  
   We will shift our focus to investors in the UK and EU. Additionally, we will consider expanding our services to emerging markets with lower regulatory risks.

# Team Challenges and Solutions
While working on our business plan, our team faced some issues with staying organized,
communicating effectively, and managing our workflow. But by using smart strategies, we were able
to solve these problems and become a stronger, more efficient team. Here are the main challenges
we dealt with and how we fixed them to succeed.
## 1. Clear Task Division & Roles
**Challenge:**
At first, we had trouble dividing tasks properly. Some team members weren't sure of their
responsibilities, leading to overlapping work and delays. As the project progressed, some areas
needed more attention than expected.
**Solution:**
To fix this, we:
- Assigned clear primary and secondary roles based on skills and interests. This setup provided
flexibility and helped everyone learn from each other.
- Used GitHub as our shared tool to track responsibilities and progress.
- Appointed team leads for major sections to ensure accountability.
- Held weekly check-ins to review and adjust workloads.
This approach gave everyone clarity on their roles while allowing flexibility for changes.
## 2. Improving Communication & Coordination
**Challenge:**
With different schedules and deadlines, some updates weren't shared on time, causing confusion.
Additionally, offline discussions sometimes led to misunderstandings.
**Solution:**
To improve communication, we:
- Set up a central chat group using WhatsApp for quick updates.
- Used GitHub for version control so everyone had access to the latest work.
- Made a rule that no big decision would be made without the whole team.
- Rotated the task of taking meeting notes to ensure important discussions were recorded and
shared.
This reduced miscommunication and kept everyone aligned.
## 3. Managing Workloads & Deadlines
**Challenge:**
Managing tasks and deadlines within the team was challenging. At times, some team members had
more work than others, which led to delays.
**Solution:**
We:
- Introduced progress checkpoints to complete work step by step instead of last-minute rushes.
- Encouraged peer reviews to improve quality and efficiency.
This helped us stay on track and maintain high-quality work.
## 4. Handling Conflicts & Different Work Styles
**Challenge:**
With eight people on the team, there were sometimes disagreements about the business model,
pricing, and who the target customers should be. These disagreements slowed down
decision-making. Also, team members didn't always agree on which features to focus on first, which
caused some tension.
**Solution:**
To handle this, we:
- Used a democratic decision-making process where everyone had a say.
- Relied on data and market research to guide choices.
- Encouraged open debates to consider all viewpoints.
By encouraging mutual respect and teamwork, we were able to use our different viewpoints as advantages.
## 5. Overcoming Technical & Research Challenges
**Challenge:**
We faced difficulties in gathering data, creating financial models, gathering real-time crime data, and
understanding legal aspects of real estate investment. Some data sources were limited.
**Solution:**
To tackle this, we:
- Split research tasks among members based on expertise.
- Used reliable sources like real estate reports and Police API Documentation.
- Validated financial models using case studies and industry benchmarks.
- Continuously refined our assumptions based on feedback.
This ensured our business model was well-researched, realistic, and ready for investors.
